Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive epithelial tumour originating both from mature hepatocytes and stem cells.
Epidemiological studies reported HCC as the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that generated
a great impact in the molecular biology field. They can negatively regulate the expression of their target genes in a post-transcriptionalmanner, inducing mRNA degradation or inhibiting mRNA translation.
Given their involvement in various pathologies including cancers, miRNAs functions started to be investigated with the help of bioinformatics approaches that allows to predict interaction with potential target genes [mirbase.org, microrna.org, genemania.org].
In this project, we want to move forward in order to obtain a list of potential genes relating to a group of significantly altered miRNAs in HCC for different species. We want to start to predict target genes for a
selected miRNAs. One of the final objective of the project is to identify functional of clusters target genes could be related to. Finally, we built up networks to visualize the possible circuits and pathways in which
selected miRNAs could be involved, providing a potential resource for other researches focused on HCC. In the future, we plan to use the outcomes of this project to consider other types of cancer.
