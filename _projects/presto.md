Description:

The PRESTO project aims at improving test-based embedded systems development and validation, while considering the constraints of industrial development processes. This project is based on the integration of:
a) test traces exploitation (generated by test execution in the software integration phase induced by the industrial development process, to validate the requirements of the system) along with
b) platform models and
c) design space exploration techniques
The expected result of the project is to establish functional and performance analysis and platform optimisation at early stage of the design development. The approach of PRESTO is to model the software/hardware allocation, by the use of modelling frameworks, such as the UML profile for model-driven development of Real Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE). The analysis tools, among them timing analysis including Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis, scheduling analysis and possibly more abstract system-level timing analysis techniques will receive as inputs on the one hand information from the performance modelling of the HW/SW-platform, and on the other hand behavioural information of the software design from tests results of the integration test execution.
