VISION aims to developing an innovative infrastructure providing 
real-time sensing services, with particular emphasis on 3D video, with mobile 
and context-aware operation: 60 GHz UWB radios to enable broadband transmissions 
in the Wireless Sensor Network; a comprehensive channel model to optimize the 
radio design; novel techniques to manage the huge number of nodes for ubiquitous 
sensing; innovative tools to support the development process of intelligent 
services; full cross-layer adaptability to external conditions to assure the 
best achievable performance and support of Quality of Services. 
VISION will study, design, implement and demonstrate an innovative system supporting intelligent services
for ubiquitous sensing, with particular emphasis on real-time 3D video sensing.
The objectives of the proposed research are numerous and call for a joint effort of groups working at
different levels, e.g. propagation, wireless sensor network design at all layers (physical, MAC, routing),
middleware, application and tools for context-aware QoS management.
