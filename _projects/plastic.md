Ubiquitous networking provides mobile users with unique features for seamlessly accessing
networked services. However, service provisioning for B3G distributed computing platforms faces
numerous challenges, among which are: developing services that can be easily deployed on a wide
range of evolving infrastructures, from networks of devices to standalone wireless resourceconstrained
handheld devices; making services resource-aware so that they can benefit from
networked resources and related services; and ensuring that users always experience the best
Quality of Service (QoS) possible according to their specific situation. In addition, services must be
provisioned in a way that guarantees their dependability. The PLASTIC project will develop a
comprehensive provisioning platform for software services deployed over B3G networks. The project
will build upon both Web services and more standard component-based technologies. The PLASTIC
platform will specifically integrate innovative methods and tools for service development, from design
to validation, and a supporting middleware for service provisioning in B3G networks. The platform will
enable dynamic adaptation of services to the environment with respect to resource availability and
delivered QoS, via a development paradigm based on Service Level Agreements and resource-aware
programming. The middleware will be service oriented, to enable integration and composition of
heterogeneous software services from both infrastructure-based and ad hoc networks. The
middleware will integrate key functions for supporting the management of adaptive services in the
open wireless environment, dealing with resource awareness and dependability. The project will
assess the PLASTIC platform through representative and challenging mobile e-services, specifically
eVoting, eLearning, eHealth and eBusiness. Key assessment factors will include cost, quality and
dependability, as well as the innovativeness of the services created.
